  “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy,<br>
  the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.”<br>
  ― C.S. Lewis

I want to be an artist in my field.  
I want to be the person who gives hope to other people in the discouragement of the era.  
I have a high interest in the culture of other countries and I am steadily studying English, Chinese and Japanese.  
  
Thanks for reading!
